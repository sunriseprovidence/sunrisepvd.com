                        <p>It's pretty simple. We're demanding that Governor Raimondo sign the <a href='http://nofossilfuelmoney.org/'>No Fossil Fuel Money pledge</a> and commit to not taking any campaign contributions over $200 from fossil fuel executives and lobbyists.</p>
                        <p>Governor Raimondo has already taken over $500,000 in campaign contributions from the fossil fuel industry, including the CEO and Founder of Invenergy, the company that tried to build the Burrillville Power Plant.</p>
