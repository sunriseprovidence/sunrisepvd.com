                        <p>Governor Raimondo has taken over $500,000 from the fossil fuel industry. That includes a <a href='/assets/documents/schusterman.pdf' target='_blank'>single contribution of $250,000</a> from Stacy Schusterman, Chairwomen of Samson Energy, an oil and gas company. Raimondo also accepted a campaign contribution from the CEO and Founder of Invenergy, <span class='text-bold'>the company that tried to build the Burrillville Power Plant.</span> When our politicians rely on the fossil fuel industry to win their elections, we know that they won't have the people's best interests at heart when they take office.</p>

                            <p>In December, we came back even stronger. Hundreds of people rallied in the cold outside the State House to once again demand that Governor Raimondo stop taking money from the fossil fuel industry and start taking action against climate change.</p>

                            <p>Meanwhile, fourteen brave young people were beginning a sit-in in the State House. They gave Governor Raimondo an ultimatum: they would stay there until the Governor pledged to stop taking money from the fossil fuel industry, or they were forcibly removed. She refused. Late that evening, all fourteen of them were arrested and released just before midnight. Governor Raimondo has the power to stop this, but she continues to put the interests of fossil fuel executives and lobbyists above the interests of everyday Rhode Islanders.</span></p>
