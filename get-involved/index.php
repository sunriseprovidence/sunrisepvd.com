                            <p>Sunrise Providence accomplished some amazing things in 2019 â€“ like organizing thousands of people for the <span class='text-bold'>historic climate strikes</span> all over Rhode Island, <span class='text-bold'>training hundreds of organizers</span> at the Northeast Regional Sunrise Summit, and getting Representative Cicilline to <span class='text-bold'>sign on to the Green New Deal</span>. This all happened because Rhode Islanders gave their time and money, signed petitions, recruited friends and family, and showed up at actions.</p>
                            <p>We need to keep the momentum going as we head into 2020 if we're going to win a Green New Deal for our state and defeat the climate crisis.</p>
                            <p>Sign up now to join the movement.</p>
                            <h5>Together, we can turn the tide.</h5>
